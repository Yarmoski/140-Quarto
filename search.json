(I will not hold you to any project ideas written here; you are welcome to change your mind later.)\n\n\n\nThere are many guides out there on how to use markdown syntax. The following is one example you may find useful:\n\nMarkdown Cheatsheet\n\nIn this assignment notebook, you will find that you are unable to alter the content of the cells that I have written -> this is on purpose. However, you will be able to edit and run all response cells.\nAfter writing your responses in markdown, execute the cells so that your markdown text gets rendered.\n\n\nInitial step:\nOpen the cell below in edit mode (by double-clicking on it), look at how it is written, and then run it. Make sure you understand how the text is marked up to get the header style, italics, bold, and a bulleted list.\n\n(double-click here to edit)"
